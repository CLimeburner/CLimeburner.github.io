# E2: Slamina New Game+
## Chip Limeburner

This is a game using Annyang and responsiveVoice libraries in which you have to guess animals based on their
names said backwards. Correct guesses will score you point, while incorrect guesses or running out of time will
score failures, until all animals have been guessed.

 Extending the in-class activity with new features and functionality as part of exercise 2.
